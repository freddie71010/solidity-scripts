# Smart Contract Lottery
1. Users can enter a lottery with ETH by paying a $50 USD equivalent fee.
2. An admin will choose when the lottery is over.
3. The lottery will select a random winner from those who entered and send them all the ETH! This random winner is determined by calling a ChainLink node to determine true randomness.
